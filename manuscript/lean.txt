### Lean Software Development

Lean philosophy regards everything not adding value to the customer as waste (muda).

Such waste may include:

* Partially done work
* Extra features
* Relearning
* Task switching
* Waiting
* Handoffs
* Defects
* Management activities

Industry research revealed these software development wastes:

* Building the wrong feature or product
* Mismanaging the backlog
* Rework
* Unnecessarily complex solutions
* Extraneous cognitive load
* Psychological distress
* Waiting/multitasking
* Knowledge loss
* Ineffective communication.

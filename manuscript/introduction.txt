# Introduction

This is the introduction.

I am going to write in as simple plain english as I can.
I am not going into the science of why all this works, maybe at a high level, but if you want more details you should dive deeper into the reference materials/bibliography.

I will limit the use of footnotes and in-line citations. This should be easy to read.

I am writing this book because I wish it exists, I hope someone finds it useful.

This book is going to be a labor of love. I want a book like this, I hope it helps someone else.

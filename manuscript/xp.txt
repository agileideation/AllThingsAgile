# eXtreme Programming (XP)

These practices are considered by many to be REQUIRED to do SCRUM successfully.

* Test Driven development
* Paired Programming

Coding

* The customer is always available
* Code the unit test first
* Only one pair integrates code at a time
* Leave optimization until last
* No overtime

Testing

* All code must have unit tests
* All code must pass all unit tests before it can be released.
* When a bug is found, tests are created before the bug is addressed (a bug is not an error in logic; it is a test that was not written)
* Acceptance tests are run often and the results are published

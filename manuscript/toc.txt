# Theory of Constraints

Eliyahu Goldratt is cool

### Five Focusing Steps

1. Identify the system's constraint(s).
2. Decide how to exploit the system's constraint(s).
3. Subordinate everything else to the above decision(s).
4. Alleviate the system's constraint(s).
5. Warning! If in the previous steps a constraint has been broken, go back to step 1, but do not allow inertia to cause a system's constraint.

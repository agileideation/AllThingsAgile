# Agile

This chapter is about Agile.

I haven't talked to anyone on the agile manifesto, but I have read their books and tweets and blog posts and listened to podcasts and talks and watched videos as much as I can, this is my best interpretation and understanding, and how I personally apply this.

[TODO: VALUES/Manifesto]

[TODO: Principles]

This chapter I will give very brief history on Agile, then go through values and principles and a section for each.

NOTE: Talk about how in Scrum book he talks about Agile not being a methodology

## Brief history


## Values and Manifesto


### We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

[TODO: Write about this]

Through this work we have come to value:

### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

[TODO: write about this]

### Working software over comprehensive documentation

[TODO: write about this]

### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

### Responding to change over following a plan

### That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Principles

We follow these principles:

### Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
